## Summary & Objective
Premier League fans have long expressed criticism toward referees, often perceiving them as biased individuals whose decisions intentionally influence the outcome of matches. As a fan myself, I have made a conscious effort to move beyond the subjective "my team" perspective and instead approach the game through an objective lens. Nonetheless, I have frequently found it difficult to dismiss the notion that certain referees exhibit bias in their calls and overall decision-making. It is important to acknowledge, however, that officiating is an inherently challenging role. Many decisions must be made instantaneously, often amid the crowd noise, player pressure, and obstructed lines of sight that complicate the referee's judgment. 

This project seeks to take an evidence-based approach. We aim to conduct statistical analyses and apply machine learning techninques to identify potential patterns in referee behavior and predict future trends. Additionally, we will explore whether there is any indication of bias, specifically toward foreign players or potential racial bias, in the distribution of cards. The dataset will encompass Premier League matches spanning from the 2009-2010 season through the 2024-2025 season.
