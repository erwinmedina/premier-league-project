This file was created to find all of the referees in the premier league.
Then after finding them, I would find their nationality, their birth city,
the nearest city to their birth town/village, and how often they appeared in the league.

This was all done by hand, and researching through google. There wasn't a good database for referee's in the premier league.
These are all the referees that appear in the incident report. 
So the referee names were compiled from the incident reports,
then the following info for each referee was found manually.

This information, although compiled separately was added into the master dataset.
