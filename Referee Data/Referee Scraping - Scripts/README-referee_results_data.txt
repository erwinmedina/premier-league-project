The result files were created because i was scraping solely the referee for each game.
Once i reached 2009, i realized that the data didn't exist past that, thus why i stopped
at 4942 rows of data. Even then, the 4000's data seems slightly off. 
Though the data is correct, cleaned, and normalized in the master dataset.

It seems that I broke this part up because I wanted to focus only on obtaining the referee info.
This data range goes from 2022-2009. The data for 2022-2025 is found in the output-summary folder.

The script here went through various iterations. Unsure if i'll keep all 4, but i settled
on the 'final_referee and attendance' file. This one was the most accurate, had time stamps to let me know
how close it was to finishing up, and had everything i needed.
