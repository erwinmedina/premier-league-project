These files were created using a script that would collect the matchday information, 
along with referee names, attendance, final score, and other info.
This was created because I didn't have access to this information prior, as the data 
only went up to 2022. 
In order to make the scraping more managable, i broke it up into parts.

Part 1 - Grab the summary
Part 2 - Grab the stats info.
Part 3 - Grab the incident report.

Because the incident report was more detailed and intricate, i left that for part 3.
